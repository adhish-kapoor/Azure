=>Azure Files is Microsoft's easy-to-use cloud file system. Azure file shares can be seamlessly used in Windows and Windows Server.

=>Availability Zones is a high-availability offering that protects your applications and data from datacenter failures. 
Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. 
Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

=>Tags for Resources are not inherited by default from their Resource Group.
A resource group can be used to scope access control for administrative actions. 
By default, permissions set at the resource level are inherited by the resources in the resource group

=>Azure storage offers different access tiers: hot, cool and archive.
The archive access tier has the lowest storage cost. But it has higher data retrieval costs compared to the hot and cool tiers. 
Data in the archive tier can take several hours to retrieve.
While a blob is in archive storage, the blob data is offline and can't be read, overwritten, or modified. 
To read or download a blob in archive, you must first rehydrate it to an online tier.

=>Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. 
It can receive and process millions of events per second. 
Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored by using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.
Azure Event Hubs can be used to ingest, buffer, store, and process your stream in real time to get actionable insights. 
Event Hubs uses a partitioned consumer model, enabling multiple applications to process the stream concurrently and letting you control the speed of processing.
Azure Event Hubs can be used to capture your data in near-real time in an Azure Blob storage or Azure Data Lake Storageג€‰for long-term retention or micro-batch processing.

=>There are different replication options available with a storage account.
The ג€˜minimumג€™ replication option is Locally Redundant Storage (LRS). With LRS, data is replicated synchronously three times within the primary region.

=>Data is not backed up automatically to another Azure Data Center although it can be depending on the replication option configured for the account. 
Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) is the default which maintains three copies of the data in the data center.
Geo-redundant storage (GRS) has cross-regional replication to protect against regional outages. 
Data is replicated synchronously three times in the primary region, then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region.

=>The current storage limit is 2 PB for US and Europe, and 500 TB for all other regions (including the UK) with no limit on the number of files.

=>Free services:
Virtual network
Private IP address
Azure migrate
Inbound internet traffic
5GB of outbound internet traffic
Azure policy
Azure AD
Azure App service

=====================================
=>To deploy AI solution in Azure, Azure resource used is "Machine Learning Studio".

=>To store sensitive infomation Azure service used is "Azure key vault"

=>When you stop using deployed VM in Azure, do you still pay for storage of that VM ? TRUE

=>A company which moves to public cloud (totally) can decommission its infrastructure ? TRUE

=>Azure Resource Manager(ARM) templates are fabricated in JSON.

=>Commands to ARM are done through Azure portal, Azure powershell and Azure CLI

=>To store unstructured data in Azure "Azure blob storage" is used.
Hot,cool and archived storage of unstructured data.

=>Uploading data to Azure cloud from on-premises is free of cost ? FALSE (have to pay as per data size)

=>A big data analysis service for ML is "Azure Databricks"

=>To deploy an IOT solution service used is "Azure sphere". It is a silicon chip for securly connecting to MS cloud.

=>Azure firewall - External protection
  Azure network security group - Internal attack prevention
  
=>If you want to move enterprise platform to cloud, SQL manages instances come under PAAS offering

=>To monitor inbound traffic in Azure, "Network security group" is used

=> Communication ------- IOT hub
   Development, monitor IOT devices ----------IOT central
   Security -------------Azure sphere
   
=>Azure service "Azure security center" makes sure that resources follow policy compliance, security hygiene.

=> Azure functions ------------ Provides platform for serverless coding
   Azure databricks ----------- Big data analysis service for ML
   Azure monitor -------------- Detects if any issue has occurred
   Azure app service ---------- Host web apps
   
   
=>Desktop virtualization provided by MS as a PAAS offering - Windows Virtual Desktop

=>In SAAS, there is nothing to worry about Software compliance/expiration/copyright issue.

=>Azure Active Directory enables SSO for MS services like outlook, teams, office 365 etc.
=>Azure Active Directory is used to generate Token for RBAC(Role Based Access Control) and MFA.

=>Azure service used to organize and retrieve all the resources - Azure tags

=>Azure provides DDOS attack prevention
Distributed Denial Of Service (External Attack Prevention)

=>To reduce the pricing of azure services:-
1. Delete app service plan if no app is running on it
2. Delete unused IP addresses
3. Delete unused VMs

=>To increase availability of the application Deploy the application in multiple regions

=>To maintain deployment consistency among all azure services within your enterprise - Use Azure Resource Manager(ARM) templates

=>Cloud based implementation of a popular data analytical platform (Hadoop) - Azure HDinsight

=> "Service Level Agreement" is a guarantee by MS for availability and uptime of a service.

============AZ-204===================

=> AzCopy tool is used to copy data from one storage account to another.

=> Traffic monitoring system monitors traffic along 6 highways. The system produces analysis based reports for each highway.
Traffic data is consumed by 4 departments.Each dept. has an azure web app to display time series-based reports and contains a webJob that processes incoming data from Event hub.
To implement Azure Event hub 6 partitions will be done based on highways.
NOTE: Partition depends on the producer, which is Highway in above scenario.

=> To configure logging we need to use "az webapp log config" command.

=> An "Ingress controller" is a piece of software that provides:
1. reverse proxy
2. configure traffic routing
3. TLS termination
for Kubernetes services.

=> For MS Graph API, we need to use User.Read permission.

=> oauth2Permissions attribute    Value type - Collection
   oauth2AllowImplicitFlow        Value type - Boolean
   
=>
